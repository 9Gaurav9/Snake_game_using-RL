Snake Game with Reinforcement Learning
This project implements a Snake game using Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques. The RL agent learns to play the game by interacting with the environment, receiving rewards, and improving its performance over time.

Overview
The Snake game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen to eat food and grow longer. The objective is to avoid collisions with the walls or itself while achieving the highest possible score.

This implementation uses a Deep Q-Learning (DQN) algorithm to train an agent to play the Snake game. The agent learns from its experiences and improves its policy to maximize the score.

Features
Reinforcement Learning: Uses DQN to train the agent.
Game Environment: Implemented using Pygame for visualization.
Training and Testing: Includes scripts for training the agent and testing its performance.
Model Saving and Loading: Save and load trained models.
Requirements
Python 3.12 or higher
TensorFlow 2.x
Keras
Pygame
NumPy
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/snake_rl.git
cd snake_rl
Install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Train the Agent:

bash
Copy code
python train.py
Test the Agent:

bash
Copy code
python test.py
Ensure that you have a trained model saved as snake-dqn-final.weights.h5 or update the filename in test.py accordingly.

Code Structure
train.py: Script for training the DQN agent.
test.py: Script for testing the trained agent.
agent.py: Contains the implementation of the DQN agent.
game.py: Contains the implementation of the Snake game environment using Pygame.
